# Capsule Bare React Native Example

## Getting Started

> **Note**: This is using a [development build of Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/), NOT Expo Go.

### Step 1: Install app dependecies

```bash
yarn
```

### Step 2: Add your API key

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `./src/clients/capsule.ts` with your valid API key.

### Step 3: Start your Application

#### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
